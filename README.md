Skin Sight AI is a deep learning-based skin disease classification system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for early, automated diagnosis of five common skin conditions using dermatoscopic images.

🚀 Features
🔍 Classifies:

-Actinic Keratosis
-Dermatofibroma
-Melanoma
-Seborrheic Keratosis
=Squamous Cell Carcinoma

🎯 Image Segmentation to isolate skin lesions

📊 Feature Extraction: color, texture, and border
🔁 Data Augmentation for robustness across skin tones
📉 Severity Estimation for condition awareness
🌍 Designed for use in remote and resource-limited settings

🧰 Tech Stack
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV (for segmentation)
NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset
Based on the HAM10000 dataset
Preprocessed and augmented for class balance and diversity

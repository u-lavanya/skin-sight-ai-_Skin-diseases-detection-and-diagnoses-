Skin Sight AI is a deep learning-based diagnostic tool that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify five common skin diseases: Actinic Keratosis, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Seborrheic Keratosis, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. It includes skin lesion segmentation, visual feature extraction, severity estimation, and robust data augmentation for diverse skin tonesâ€”designed to support early diagnosis in both clinical and remote settings.
